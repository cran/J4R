The J4R package
===============

More specifically, it allows to create Java objects and to invoke Java methods,
whether they are static or not. The package is based on a local Java server that
is instantiated through a Java library packaged as j4r.jar. This Java library is
licensed under the Lesser GNU General Public License v3.0 (LGPL-3). Both the J4R
package and the j4r Java library come with absolutely NO WARRANTY.
